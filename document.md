# Sample Node.js Application

This document provides an overview of a sample Node.js application, including its architecture and workflow. The diagrams are created using Mermaid for better visualization.

## Application Overview

The sample Node.js application is a RESTful API that performs CRUD operations on a database. It uses the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the application.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for handling HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage.
